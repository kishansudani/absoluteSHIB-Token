- This contract is used for swapping shib token to ABSOLUTESHIB token.

## WHY?

- There is too much of supply of current shib so we want to reduce the supply.

## How?

- In this contract you will burn your own shib.

## Why should I burn my shib and burn my own money?

- Burning your own shib will get new token which is called ABSOLUTESHIB. 

- so reducing shib supply will get you new token and which is in lower ratio.
